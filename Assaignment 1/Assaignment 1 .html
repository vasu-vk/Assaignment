console.log(1 + "2" + "2");  //output : 122 // + is an concatenate operator so the output is 122

console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");  //output : 32// "2" is of type variant so + operator converts the string into a number (1+2=3 + "2" ) and + operator concatenate , so the output is 32

console.log(1 + -"1" + "2"); //output : 02// "1" is of type variant so - operator converts the sring to a number (1-1=0 + "2") and + concate these two values and the result is 02

console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2"); //output : 112//+"1" here "1" is of type variant when + operator is used it is converted to a number similarly +"1"  +"2" are converted to numbers 1 and 2 when the concatenate symbol is used the output is 112

console.log( "A" - "B" + "2"); //output : NaN2// "A" is  of type variant string there are no values in it so it is of type Not-a-Number(NaN) when the symbol - is used it subtracts as the type of A b is string it genrates NaN2, here +"2" is converted to a number  

console.log( "A" - "B" + 2); //output : NaN// ""A" is  of type variant string there are no values in it so it is of type Not-a-Number(NaN) when the symbol - is used it subtracts as the type of A b is string it genrates NaN so the output is NaN
